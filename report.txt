PROJECT 2 - DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

b. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:
The main challenge encountered was managing memory correctly with dynamic 2D arrays for the adjacency matrix without using STL containers like vector. I had to carefully allocate and deallocate memory in the Graph constructor and destructor to avoid memory leaks. Additionally, there was a typo in the provided Vertex.cpp template (line 9: 'Index' instead of 'index') that needed to be fixed for the code to compile.

c. KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION:
There are no known bugs in the current implementation. All three required outputs (adjacency matrix, odd-degree nodes, and Dijkstra's shortest paths) are fully implemented and tested. The program correctly handles the sample test case (tiny-weighted.txt) and produces output matching the expected format.

d. EXTERNAL RESOURCES USED:
- Dijkstra's algorithm and graph algorithms lecture notes from CSE 310
- cppreference.com (2024). C++ Standard Library Reference. https://en.cppreference.com/w/ - Used for iostream, climits, and dynamic memory allocation documentation
- Cormen, T. H., Leiserson, C. E., Rivest, R. L., & Stein, C. (2009). Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.). MIT Press. - Reference for Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
- Project specification document provided on Canvas

e. DESIGN DECISIONS:
Data Structures:
- Adjacency Matrix: I used a dynamically allocated 2D integer array (int**) to store the graph's adjacency matrix, with 0 representing no edge between nodes and positive integers representing edge weights. This allows O(1) edge lookup time.
- Vertex Array: Created an array of Vertex objects to store each node's index and degree information.
- Dijkstra's Arrays: Used simple integer arrays for distances (dist[]) and boolean arrays for visited status (visited[]) during Dijkstra's algorithm execution.

Classes and Modular Design:
- Graph Class: Designed a Graph class that encapsulates all graph operations including adding edges, calculating degrees, printing the adjacency matrix, finding odd-degree nodes, and running Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Vertex Class: Used the provided Vertex class to store node properties (index and degree).
- Edge Class: The provided Edge class was kept for potential future use, though not extensively used in the current implementation.

Algorithm Implementation:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Implemented the classic single-source shortest path algorithm using a simple linear search to find the minimum distance unvisited vertex in each iteration. This results in O(V²) time complexity, which is acceptable for the project requirements.
- Degree Calculation: Computed each vertex's degree by counting non-zero entries in its adjacency matrix row.
- Odd-Degree Detection: Iterated through all vertices and collected those with odd degrees into a dynamically allocated array, then sorted by index (naturally sorted due to sequential iteration).

The implementation successfully compiles with the provided Makefile and correctly processes the input format specified, producing output that matches the expected format exactly.
